Hmmm. I have an Idea. connect the whole shit to amazon api

1-30
consider bestbuy api also 
clone malltina.com

@todo: Get products from amazon api
i find amazon site stripe: https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/stripe.html

Buils a backend  - only to add products and save orders and signup users
